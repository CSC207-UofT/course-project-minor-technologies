# CSC207 Project - Scenario Walk-Through:

The purpose of the skeleton program in Phase 0 is to demonstrate one of the core features of our program. Consider the following scenario: A user searches for a job listing. After finding some listings, the user saves this collection of job listings which will be automatically updated by the program.

For the skeleton program, LocalCache initiates and loads job listings from the DemoListings by calling loadSavedListings(), which makes LocalCache interact with FileIO and DataFormat to create Listing objects containing the job listing data as well as their corresponding UID. So, FileIO is responsible for reading JSON files that contain information regarding job listings. Then, DataFormat uses what FileIO returns (i.e. a string representation of the job listing data in JSON format) to create a Listing object, which is then stored on a HashMap containing all the job listings by the LocalCache class. Then, the program asks the user to enter its name as well as what it wants to do, the user can type “help” to get the commands, “exit” to exit the program, “search” if the user has a search query, or “saved” if the user wants to access its viewed listings.  For the option “search”, the user will have to input search terms, location, date, and job type. With the given information, a SearchQuery object is generated and it is used by the Search class. Search class interacts with LocalCache class and searches job listings, which match the user’s search query, within its loaded Listing objects. Then, relevant listings based on the user’s search key terms are printed and the user chooses a listing. Then, the user decides whether it wants to view the listing or not. If the job listing the user is currently viewing is not in its collection of viewed listings, then the user can choose to add the listing to its collection or not.  Any job listing that has been added by the user to its collection of viewed listings will update its information automatically. This is because while the user is either searching for job listings or accessing its viewed job listings, the BackgroundOperations class uses another thread to update the user’s viewed listings information if needed and it accomplishes this by calling the method loadListingFromUID() which belongs to LocalCache class. That being said, if a job listing’s information is updated, then the user can call the program and type the “saved” command to access the job listing and see its updates.
